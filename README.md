Assignment Title: Build a Basic Task Management System

Objective:

Develop a simple Task Management System that allows users to create, view, update, and delete
tasks. The system should focus on core CRUD operations, usability, and efficient code structure.

Requirements:

1. Backend:

- Use Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js to create a RESTful API with endpoints for:
- Creating a new task (title, description, due date, status).
- Viewing all tasks.
- Updating an existing task.
- Deleting a task.
- Tasks should be stored in an SQLite database for simplicity.

2. Frontend:

- Build a minimal UI using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a lightweight framework like React.
- Features should include:
- A form to create a new task.
- A list view to display all tasks.
- Edit and delete buttons for each task.
- Filters to view tasks by status (e.g., Pending, Completed).

3. Additional Features (Optional for Extra Credit):

- Add a status change feature with a toggle between Pending and Completed.
